		 <h4>January 24 - Bluefish 2.2.11 release</h4>
		 <p>Bluefish 2.2.11 is a minor maintenance release and minor feature release. The only exception to that is the python 3 compatibility which is a major change. If you compile Bluefish with python 3, you might experience new bugs. There are various minor changes as well. Double click selection has been improved (for example selecting a function name that has underscores), and is now configurable per language. Bluefish now has a feature to fill a line with spaces up to a mouse click, so you can start typing in any position on the screen (with a fixed width font). A crash when running very large replace actions on disk on many files has been fixed. Search and replace now ignores backup files by default. Cursor highlighting and line highlighting have been fixed for a rare bug. A small new feature has been added, to insert output from an external command in the current cursor position. Many language files have seen updates, most notably CSS, Python and HTML. A data loss bug - when an unknown encoding was selected - was fixed, the fallback is now to save as UTF-8. A bug when saving with unknown characters in the filename has also been fixed. Printing has been improved such as printing in landscape. Some small tweaks to the UI have been implemented. For example you can now search in files in the filebrowser (right click a directory). Search results can now be shown in the output pane. The current identifier can be selected using <shift><control><i></i>. Last there various fixes when Bluefish is run on top of Wayland.</p>
